Our team has created an obstacle avoiding robot, which takes inspiration from a RADAR for design. We used an ultrasonic sensor along with a servo motor as an axle.
The microcontroller we chose is a Arduino Nano. The code is far from complete as it needs a little modification regarding integration of speed control of L293N with pwm pins of Arduino.
